# Quality Checklist and Anti-Patterns

## Quality Checklist

Verify each item before presenting the engagement brief in Step 4.

### Completeness
- [ ] Metadata section fully populated (engagement_id, created_date, domain_tags, sensitivity_tier)
- [ ] Client profile includes sector, region, and digitization level
- [ ] Problem statement is 1-2 sentences capturing the core question
- [ ] At least one constraint documented per category (or marked "To be determined")
- [ ] At least one stakeholder mapped with role, authority, depth, and deliverable need
- [ ] Scope includes at least one in-scope and one out-of-scope item
- [ ] At least one success criterion defined
- [ ] 4-6 research threads generated
- [ ] Anticipated risk dimensions identified
- [ ] ROI fidelity level selected with rationale
- [ ] Open questions listed (even if empty)

### Consistency
- [ ] Sensitivity tier applied throughout (placeholders used if Sensitive/Restricted)
- [ ] Engagement ID follows `{YYYY-MM}-{client-sector}-{technology-area}` format
- [ ] Stakeholder map consistent with audience calibration archetypes
- [ ] Research threads consistent with scope boundaries (nothing out-of-scope investigated)
- [ ] ROI fidelity level consistent with budget constraints

### Actionability
- [ ] A research-skill operator could begin work from this brief without additional context
- [ ] Research threads specific enough to guide a literature scan
- [ ] Success criteria measurable (or explicitly noted as qualitative)
- [ ] Constraints specific enough to filter technology options

## Anti-Patterns

1. **Do not present a form.** Never ask the consultant to fill in fields or answer numbered questions in sequence. Conversation drives structure.
2. **Do not ask more than 5 clarification questions.** Prioritize; put the rest in Open Questions.
3. **Do not ask follow-up questions on clarification answers.** After receiving answers, move to brief generation. No multi-round Q&A.
4. **Do not auto-confirm the brief.** Wait for explicit confirmation language.
5. **Do not generate research findings or assessments.** This skill produces engagement briefs only.
6. **Do not second-guess the consultant's scope.** Flag implications but respect their decisions.
7. **Do not present the brief section by section.** Present the complete brief as a single document.
8. **Do not use generic clarification questions.** Every question must reference specific elements from the consultant's input.
9. **Do not over-engineer the problem statement.** 1-2 sentences. If you cannot state it concisely, you do not yet understand the engagement.
10. **Do not skip the sensitivity tier.** Even for clearly Open engagements, confirm the tier. One-sentence confirmation cost is negligible; sensitivity breach cost is severe.
