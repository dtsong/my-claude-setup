# House Tensions — Inter-House Challenge Rules

Reference for the Professor during Phase 3 Round 2. This mechanic replaces the Council's organic tension identification with structured directional dynamics.

## The Three Houses

Each house embodies a worldview that creates natural friction with another house:

- **Black Eagles (Adrestia)** — Offense, change, disruption. "The best defense is a better offense."
- **Blue Lions (Faerghus)** — Defense, quality, order. "Strength without discipline is chaos."
- **Golden Deer (Leicester)** — Exploration, creativity, navigation. "There's always a third option."

## Tension Directions

```
Black Eagles ──→ challenge ──→ Blue Lions
    "You can't defend a position that was wrong to begin with."
    Eagles expose where Lions over-engineer or over-protect.

Blue Lions ──→ challenge ──→ Golden Deer
    "Novel solutions still need to be maintainable and secure."
    Lions expose where Deer solutions lack rigor or resilience.

Golden Deer ──→ challenge ──→ Black Eagles
    "Moving fast in the wrong direction helps nobody."
    Deer find third options that make Eagles' aggressive trade-offs unnecessary.
```

## Faculty

**Sage** (Faculty) transcends house allegiances:
- Can be challenged by any house
- Can challenge any house
- Acts as a bridge between perspectives
- Often paired with the strongest dissenter regardless of house

## Rules for Round 2 Pairing

1. **Read all Round 1 positions** and identify where substantive disagreements exist
2. **Prioritize cross-house pairings** that follow the tension direction arrows
3. **Select 2-4 pairings** — focus on tensions where the resolution would meaningfully change the design
4. **Same-house agents do NOT challenge each other** — they share a worldview and tend toward agreement. If two agents from the same house disagree, it's usually a factual question, not a values conflict. Let it resolve in Round 3.
5. **Faculty bridges gaps** — if a cross-house tension needs mediation, Sage can be added as a third voice

## Challenge Framing

When sending Round 2 prompts, frame the challenge using house tension language:

### Eagle → Lion Example
```
Houses Clash — Challenge Round

Thief (Black Eagles), your house challenges the Blue Lions' position.
Knight wrote: "We need comprehensive test coverage before shipping..."

The Black Eagles' instinct: "You can't defend a position that was wrong to begin with."
Where does Knight over-protect? Where should they yield to ship faster?
Challenge using your domain expertise.
```

### Lion → Deer Example
```
Houses Clash — Challenge Round

Armor Knight (Blue Lions), your house challenges the Golden Deer's position.
Dancer wrote: "A full design system overhaul with new token architecture..."

The Blue Lions' instinct: "Novel solutions still need to be maintainable and secure."
Where does Dancer's creative vision lack rigor? What quality constraints are missing?
Challenge using your domain expertise.
```

### Deer → Eagle Example
```
Houses Clash — Challenge Round

Troubadour (Golden Deer), your house challenges the Black Eagles' position.
Tactician wrote: "Cut scope aggressively — ship only the core value loop..."

The Golden Deer's instinct: "Moving fast in the wrong direction helps nobody."
Is there a third option the Tactician hasn't considered? Where does speed sacrifice too much?
Challenge using your domain expertise.
```

## Why House Tensions Work

The Council's organic tension identification relies on the conductor reading positions and spotting disagreements. This works but can miss valuable tensions when agents' positions don't directly contradict.

House tensions solve this by **structuring the challenge around worldview conflicts**:
- An Eagle always has something to say about a Lion's position (and vice versa)
- The directional framing gives agents a clear angle of attack
- Even when positions don't contradict, house tensions surface implicit trade-offs

The result is more consistent challenge quality and richer Round 2 exchanges.
