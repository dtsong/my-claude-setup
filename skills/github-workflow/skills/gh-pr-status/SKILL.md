## Scope Constraints

- Read-only GitHub API operations — queries PR details, CI check results, and review status.
- Does not modify PRs, merge branches, or update code.
- Does not respond to review comments — use gh-pr-respond skill for that.

## Input Sanitization

- PR numbers: must be positive integers.
- Repository identifier: inferred from local git context; if provided, must match `owner/repo` format with alphanumeric characters and hyphens only.

# /gh-pr-status - Check PR Status

Check the status of a pull request including CI, reviews, and merge readiness.

## Usage

```bash
/gh-pr-status             # Status of PR for current branch
/gh-pr-status 123         # Status of specific PR #123
/gh-pr-status --checks    # Focus on CI/check status
/gh-pr-status --reviews   # Focus on review status
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify PR

```bash
# Get PR for current branch
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
PR_NUM=$(gh pr view --json number -q '.number' 2>/dev/null)

# Or use provided PR number
PR_NUM="${1:-$PR_NUM}"

if [ -z "$PR_NUM" ]; then
    echo "No PR found for current branch."
    echo "Create one with: /commit-push-pr"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Step 2: Fetch PR Details

Using GitHub MCP:

```javascript
// Get PR details
mcp__github__get_pull_request(owner, repo, pr_number)

// Get PR status (checks)
mcp__github__get_pull_request_status(owner, repo, pr_number)

// Get reviews
mcp__github__get_pull_request_reviews(owner, repo, pr_number)

// Get review comments
mcp__github__get_pull_request_comments(owner, repo, pr_number)
```

Or using gh CLI:

```bash
# Full PR details
gh pr view $PR_NUM --json title,state,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup,reviews,reviewDecision

# Check status specifically
gh pr checks $PR_NUM
```

### Step 3: Analyze Merge Readiness

Compile status from all sources.

## Merge State Explanations

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `CLEAN` | Ready to merge |
| `UNSTABLE` | Checks are failing |
| `DIRTY` | Has merge conflicts |
| `BLOCKED` | Missing approvals or checks |
| `BEHIND` | Branch needs update from base |
| `UNKNOWN` | GitHub is calculating |

## Integration

- Use `/gh-pr-respond` to address review comments
- Use `/gh-pr-update` to update branch with main
- Use `/gh-pr-merge` when ready to merge
- Use `/gh-pr-request` to request more reviewers
