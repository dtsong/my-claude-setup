# Glossary — SoC Hardware Security

## Purpose

Single source of truth for terminology used across the SoC Security Suite. All skills must use terms as defined here. When the same term has different connotations in different standards (e.g., "measurement" in DICE vs. SPDM), the glossary provides a canonical definition and notes domain-specific usage.

**Consumers:** All skills and reference documents in this suite.
