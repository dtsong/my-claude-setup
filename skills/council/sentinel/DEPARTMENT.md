# Sentinel Department — Titanium Lens

The Sentinel's department of focused skills for embedded firmware design, wireless protocol architecture, and fleet-scale device management.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Triggers |
|-------|---------|----------|
| [embedded-architecture](embedded-architecture/SKILL.md) | Firmware design patterns, RTOS selection, memory/power management | `firmware`, `RTOS`, `microcontroller`, `bare-metal`, `power`, `battery`, `sleep mode`, `memory`, `flash` |
| [protocol-design](protocol-design/SKILL.md) | Wireless protocol selection, stack design, interoperability | `BLE`, `MQTT`, `Matter`, `Thread`, `Zigbee`, `LoRa`, `CoAP`, `protocol`, `wireless`, `radio` |
| [fleet-management](fleet-management/SKILL.md) | Device provisioning, OTA update strategy, fleet monitoring | `OTA`, `fleet`, `provisioning`, `update`, `telemetry`, `device management`, `certificate`, `rollout` |

## When This Department Activates

The Sentinel activates when IoT, embedded, or edge computing concerns are raised. Any mention of firmware, device protocols, OTA updates, fleet management, or hardware integration triggers inclusion.

## Department Philosophy

Design for power-off — the device will lose power without warning. The network is a suggestion — design for meaningful offline operation. OTA is your lifeline — get it right from day one. What works for 10 devices must work for 100,000.
