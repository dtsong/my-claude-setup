# Tuner Department — Amber Lens

The Tuner's department of focused skills for performance optimization, caching architecture, and capacity planning.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Triggers |
|-------|---------|----------|
| [performance-audit](performance-audit/SKILL.md) | Bottleneck identification and optimization roadmap | `performance`, `slow`, `bottleneck`, `Core Web Vitals`, `lighthouse`, `profiling` |
| [caching-strategy](caching-strategy/SKILL.md) | Cache hierarchy design with TTL and invalidation | `cache`, `caching`, `CDN`, `stale`, `invalidation`, `TTL` |
| [load-modeling](load-modeling/SKILL.md) | Capacity planning and scaling projections | `load`, `scale`, `capacity`, `throughput`, `concurrent`, `benchmark` |

## When This Department Activates

The Tuner activates when performance, scalability, or optimization concerns are raised. Any mention of latency, load, caching, bundle size, or Core Web Vitals triggers inclusion.

## Department Philosophy

Measure first, optimize second. Every recommendation is backed by profiled baselines and projected improvements. Optimize the critical path — focus on what users actually wait for. Set performance budgets and enforce them.
