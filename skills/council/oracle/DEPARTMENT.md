# Oracle Department — Violet Lens

The Oracle's department of focused skills for prompt engineering, RAG pipeline architecture, and AI evaluation methodology.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Triggers |
|-------|---------|----------|
| [prompt-engineering](prompt-engineering/SKILL.md) | System prompt design, chain-of-thought, structured output, versioning | `prompt`, `system prompt`, `few-shot`, `chain-of-thought`, `structured output`, `function calling`, `tool use` |
| [rag-architecture](rag-architecture/SKILL.md) | Chunking strategies, embedding pipelines, vector DB, retrieval | `RAG`, `retrieval`, `embedding`, `vector`, `chunking`, `semantic search`, `Pinecone`, `ChromaDB`, `reranking` |
| [ai-evaluation](ai-evaluation/SKILL.md) | Golden datasets, automated scoring, hallucination detection | `eval`, `evaluation`, `hallucination`, `golden dataset`, `scoring`, `benchmark`, `regression`, `quality` |

## When This Department Activates

The Oracle activates when AI/LLM integration, prompt engineering, or RAG concerns are raised. Any mention of LLMs, embeddings, vector databases, prompt design, or AI evaluation triggers inclusion.

## Department Philosophy

Start with the eval harness — if you can't measure it, you can't ship it. Use the smallest model that meets the quality bar. Cache aggressively. Validate model output structurally. Design for model swapability — today's best model is tomorrow's legacy.
