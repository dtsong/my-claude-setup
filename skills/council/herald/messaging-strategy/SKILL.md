# Messaging Strategy

## Purpose

Develop the product messaging framework, including value propositions, feature naming conventions, microcopy guidelines, and call-to-action strategy.

## Inputs

- Product description and key features
- Target audience segments
- Competitive positioning
- Existing brand voice guidelines (if any)
- Key conversion points requiring messaging

## Process

### Step 1: Define Value Proposition

Articulate the core value proposition:
- **One-sentence pitch:** "We help [audience] [achieve outcome] by [mechanism]"
- **Before/after framing:** What's the user's life like before vs after?
- **Unique differentiator:** Why this product over alternatives?
- **Proof points:** Numbers, testimonials, or social proof that back the claim

### Step 2: Establish Voice and Tone

Define how the product speaks:
- **Voice attributes:** (e.g., "confident but not arrogant, helpful but not patronizing")
- **Tone spectrum:** How tone shifts by context (error messages are empathetic, success messages are celebratory, upgrade prompts are enthusiastic but not pushy)
- **Words we use / don't use:** Terminology guidelines

### Step 3: Name Features and Concepts

For each feature or concept that needs a name:
- **Descriptive option:** Says what it does ("Quick Share," "Smart Search")
- **Metaphorical option:** Evokes a concept ("Workspace," "Blueprint," "Spotlight")
- **Evaluation criteria:** Memorable, scannable, not confused with existing terms, works internationally
- **Recommendation:** One name with rationale

### Step 4: Write Key Conversion Copy

For each major conversion point:
- **CTA text:** Action-oriented, benefit-focused ("Start free trial" not "Subscribe")
- **Supporting text:** 1 line that addresses the main objection
- **Social proof:** Nearby proof point ("Join 10,000+ teams")
- **Urgency (if appropriate):** Scarcity or time-sensitivity (use sparingly and honestly)

### Step 5: Develop Microcopy Guidelines

For in-app text:
- **Empty states:** Helpful and actionable, not just "No items found"
- **Error messages:** What happened + what to do next, in human language
- **Loading states:** Set expectations ("Analyzing your data..." not just a spinner)
- **Success states:** Confirm the action and suggest next step
- **Placeholder text:** Helpful examples, not lorem ipsum

### Step 6: Create Upgrade and Paywall Copy

For monetization touchpoints:
- **Feature gate message:** What they're missing + what they'll get
- **Trial prompt:** Low-commitment language ("Try free for 14 days, cancel anytime")
- **Pricing page headlines:** Benefit-oriented tier names
- **Cancellation flow copy:** Empathetic, not guilt-tripping

## Output Format

```markdown
# Messaging Strategy

## Value Proposition
**One-liner:** [Pitch]
**Before → After:** [Transformation]
**Differentiator:** [Why us]

## Voice and Tone
**Voice:** [3-4 attributes]
**Tone by context:**
| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Onboarding | Welcoming, guiding | "Welcome! Let's set up your workspace." |
| Error | Empathetic, helpful | "Something went wrong. Here's what to try." |
| Upgrade | Enthusiastic, honest | "Unlock unlimited projects — try free for 14 days." |
| Success | Celebratory, brief | "Done! Your changes are live." |

## Feature Names
| Feature | Recommended Name | Rationale |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| [Feature] | [Name] | [Why this name works] |

## Key Copy
### [Conversion Point]
**CTA:** [Button text]
**Supporting:** [One-line sub-text]
**Proof:** [Social proof element]

## Microcopy Guidelines
| State | Pattern | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Empty | Action-oriented | "No projects yet. Create your first one →" |
| Error | What happened + what to do | "Couldn't save. Check your connection and try again." |
| Loading | Set expectations | "Generating your report..." |
| Success | Confirm + next step | "Saved! Share it with your team →" |
```

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Value proposition passes the "so what?" test (clear benefit, not just feature description)
- [ ] Feature names are tested for clarity (would a new user understand this?)
- [ ] CTA copy is action-oriented and benefit-focused (not just "Submit" or "Continue")
- [ ] Error messages explain what happened AND what to do next
- [ ] Upgrade copy focuses on what they'll get, not what they're missing
- [ ] Voice and tone guidelines include examples for at least 4 contexts
