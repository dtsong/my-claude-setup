# Pathfinder Department — Coral Lens

The Pathfinder's department of focused skills for mobile development, cross-platform architecture, and native platform integration.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Triggers |
|-------|---------|----------|
| [platform-audit](platform-audit/SKILL.md) | Platform guideline compliance across iOS, Android, web | `iOS`, `Android`, `HIG`, `Material Design`, `platform`, `guideline`, `compliance`, `app review` |
| [navigation-design](navigation-design/SKILL.md) | Mobile navigation patterns, deep linking, state preservation | `navigation`, `deep link`, `universal link`, `tab bar`, `stack`, `routing`, `back button`, `state restoration` |
| [device-integration](device-integration/SKILL.md) | Hardware API integration — sensors, permissions, biometrics | `camera`, `GPS`, `biometric`, `Face ID`, `NFC`, `haptic`, `sensor`, `permission`, `bluetooth` |

## When This Department Activates

The Pathfinder activates when mobile or cross-platform concerns are raised. Any mention of iOS, Android, native apps, React Native, Flutter, offline-first, or device APIs triggers inclusion.

## Department Philosophy

Respect each platform's conventions — iOS has its patterns, Android has its own. Design for offline first, then layer on sync. The OS will kill your app without warning, so every piece of state must survive that event. Share logic aggressively, share UI cautiously.
