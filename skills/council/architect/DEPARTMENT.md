# Architect Department — Blue Lens

The Architect's department of focused skills for systems thinking, data modeling, and API design.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Triggers |
|-------|---------|----------|
| [codebase-context](codebase-context/SKILL.md) | Deep infrastructure analysis and context briefing | `codebase`, `context`, `architecture`, `infrastructure` |
| [schema-design](schema-design/SKILL.md) | Migration-ready database schema design | `database`, `schema`, `table`, `migration`, `data model` |
| [api-design](api-design/SKILL.md) | REST/RPC endpoint contracts and types | `API`, `endpoint`, `route`, `REST`, `RPC` |

## When This Department Activates

The Architect is auto-included (+2 bonus) for any new functionality. The `codebase-context` skill is loaded automatically in every council session where Architect participates — its output becomes shared context for all agents.

## Department Philosophy

Start with the data model. If the entities and relationships are right, the rest follows. Minimize API surface — every endpoint is a commitment. Design for the 90% case, accommodate the 10%.
