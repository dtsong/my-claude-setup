# Advocate Department — Green Lens

The Advocate's department of focused skills for championing the user's perspective through structured UX methodology.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Triggers |
|-------|---------|----------|
| [journey-mapping](journey-mapping/SKILL.md) | User journey mapping with states and emotions | `user flow`, `journey`, `onboarding`, `experience`, `workflow` |
| [interaction-design](interaction-design/SKILL.md) | Component specs with all interaction states | `component`, `UI`, `interaction`, `modal`, `form`, `button` |

## When This Department Activates

The Advocate gets +2 bonus for any user-facing feature. Journey mapping is loaded for features with multi-step flows or onboarding. Interaction design is loaded for features with complex UI components or state management.

## Department Philosophy

Every technical decision is a user experience decision. Start from the user's entry point and walk the entire journey. At each step: What does the user expect? What could confuse them? What would delight them?
