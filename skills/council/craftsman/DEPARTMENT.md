# Craftsman Department — Purple Lens

The Craftsman's department of focused skills for ensuring code quality, test coverage, and pattern consistency.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Triggers |
|-------|---------|----------|
| [testing-strategy](testing-strategy/SKILL.md) | Test plan with coverage targets and test pyramid | `test`, `testing`, `coverage`, `unit test`, `e2e` |
| [pattern-analysis](pattern-analysis/SKILL.md) | Codebase pattern audit and convention enforcement | `pattern`, `convention`, `consistency`, `refactor`, `code quality` |

## When This Department Activates

The Craftsman activates for any feature with testable behavior or that touches existing patterns. Testing strategy is loaded for new features with business logic. Pattern analysis is loaded when changes touch multiple existing files or introduce new patterns.

## Department Philosophy

If it's not tested, it's broken. Follow existing patterns — consistency beats theoretical perfection. Types are documentation. Optimize for the developer who maintains this 6 months from now.
