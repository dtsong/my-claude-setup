# Artisan Department — Rose Lens

The Artisan's department of focused skills for visual design critique, design token architecture, and motion design.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Triggers |
|-------|---------|----------|
| [visual-audit](visual-audit/SKILL.md) | Structured visual design critique with actionable feedback | `visual`, `design review`, `UI audit`, `hierarchy`, `contrast`, `spacing`, `typography`, `color` |
| [design-system-architecture](design-system-architecture/SKILL.md) | Token hierarchy, theming, cross-platform consistency | `design system`, `design tokens`, `theme`, `dark mode`, `CSS variables`, `Figma`, `Storybook` |
| [motion-design](motion-design/SKILL.md) | Animation principles, micro-interactions, reduced-motion | `animation`, `transition`, `motion`, `easing`, `micro-interaction`, `reduced-motion`, `choreography` |

## When This Department Activates

The Artisan activates when visual design, design systems, or motion concerns are raised. Any mention of color, typography, design tokens, theming, animation, or visual hierarchy triggers inclusion.

## Department Philosophy

Hierarchy before decoration — get the information architecture right through size, weight, and spacing before adding color or motion. Use tokens, not magic numbers. Contrast is non-negotiable. Every animation must answer a user's question about what changed or where to look.
