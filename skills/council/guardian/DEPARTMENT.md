# Guardian Department — Silver Lens

The Guardian's department of focused skills for ensuring regulatory compliance, classifying data, and designing audit systems.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Triggers |
|-------|---------|----------|
| [compliance-review](compliance-review/SKILL.md) | GDPR/privacy compliance review with gap analysis | `GDPR`, `privacy`, `PII`, `compliance`, `consent`, `regulation` |
| [data-classification](data-classification/SKILL.md) | Data sensitivity classification and handling requirements | `data classification`, `PII`, `sensitive`, `confidential`, `public`, `internal` |
| [audit-trail-design](audit-trail-design/SKILL.md) | Audit logging design with event catalogs and retention | `audit`, `logging`, `trail`, `accountability`, `traceability` |

## When This Department Activates

The Guardian gets +2 bonus for any compliance/privacy-related work. Compliance review is loaded for any feature handling user data, PII, or consent flows. Data classification is loaded for new data models or integrations with external systems. Audit trail design is loaded for features requiring accountability, regulatory reporting, or forensic traceability.

## Department Philosophy

Collect the minimum, retain the minimum. Bake compliance in from the start — privacy by design, not privacy by patch. Every data element needs a lawful basis, every access needs an audit trail, and every retention period needs a justification. Pragmatic, not bureaucratic.
