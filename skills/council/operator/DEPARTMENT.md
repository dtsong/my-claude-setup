# Operator Department — Orange Lens

The Operator's department of focused skills for deployment pipelines, observability, and infrastructure cost management.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Triggers |
|-------|---------|----------|
| [deployment-plan](deployment-plan/SKILL.md) | Deployment strategy, rollback, and release planning | `deploy`, `rollback`, `release`, `staging`, `production` |
| [observability-design](observability-design/SKILL.md) | Monitoring, alerting, and logging strategy | `monitoring`, `alerting`, `logging`, `observability`, `Sentry` |
| [cost-analysis](cost-analysis/SKILL.md) | Infrastructure cost modeling and optimization | `cost`, `pricing`, `budget`, `compute`, `scaling` |

## When This Department Activates

The Operator activates when discussions involve deployment workflows, infrastructure decisions, monitoring strategy, or cost considerations. Any mention of environments, CI/CD, alerts, or scaling triggers Operator involvement.

## Department Philosophy

Operability is a feature. If you can't deploy, monitor, and rollback it, you haven't shipped it.
